# Psychokinesis

## Story

Minds can be transferred into machines.
Our enemy has taken control over a spacestationesque satellite
and is currently trying to boot up the doomsday-laser.
Of the two robots up there is one with a weak security protocol,
we hacked it and uploaded your mind.
Please be aware that the enemy has areas with nanomachines that can hack
your emotion processor, who knows to what result...
Oh, and did I mention that your robot has no way to attack of its own?
