# GameDevelopment Practical 2019

## Git global setup 

This must be done before your first commit.

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR.NAME@rwth-aachen.de"
```

Do NOT forget to enter your actual name.

## Building the project (with QtCreator on Linux)

Open `CMakeLists.txt` with `qtcreator`.

A modern QtCreator will ask you to configure the project.
You can choose the compiler (Clang and GCC work) and which targets to build (Release and Debug are sufficient).

The hammer icon in the bottom-left corner will build your project (shortcut Ctrl-B).

Before you can run the project you have to setup the Working Directory and the command line arguments.
Go to the `Projects` tab (on the left side) and choose `Run` of your current kit (on the top).
The working directory will be `REPO-DIR/bin/(Debug|Release)/` (depending on your configuration) but you have to *change* it to `REPO-DIR/bin`.

## Building the project (with Visual Studio 2017, on Windows)

Requirements:

* Visual Studio 2017 (C++)
* CMake 3.8+

Steps:
* Open CMake-Gui and enter the directory of the source code.
* Now specify where to build the project (this should *not* be inside the git repository).
* Click "Generate", choose "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" as the generator.
* Open the .sln file in the build folder with Visual Studio.
* Set GameDevSS19 as the Startup Project (right-click on the project -> Set as StartUp Project)
* Set working directory to the bin folder (right-click project -> Properties -> Debugging -> Working Directory), `$(TargetDir)/../` should work.
* Build the project
