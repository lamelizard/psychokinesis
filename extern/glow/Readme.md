# GLOW - OpenGL Object-oriented Wrapper

## Requirements

* C++11
* CMake 3.0+
* OpenGL 3.3+

* Built-in Shader/VAO/Texture loading using static functions
* Proper smart pointer usage
* Automatic resource reloading for debugging
* Lean core library with optional extensions
* Forward declarations to reduce compile time
* Doxygen documentation
